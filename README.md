# C_Language_Set-01_Basic_Declaration_and_Expressions

C language is my first language that I learned since first year college. I practice the coding, programming and understanding what I code which I must know what is execution, what is logic in programming and what is the best efficiency during debugging or execution.

This is the first set of C language of programs which called Basic Declaration and Expression. I was so perfectionist about the coding even I put the instructions and of course I put the comments in every line to die hard of understanding and practicing.

Since my finished source codes is stock in my storage and kind of useless now because IT IS TOO BASIC TO WHAT I CODE, I'll committed them in GitHub and share to you for those are very perfect beginners and hard to understand to read source codes in every line in C language. You can read and understand the source code that was I code. 

If you really appreciate my finished die hard source code, thank you very much I appreciate you have done too. If you want to talk to me personally or virtually, you can contact on Facebook same name, but you MUST INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN CHAT AND FRIEND REQUEST TO ME (I'M VERY STRICT ABOUT THE SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD.)
